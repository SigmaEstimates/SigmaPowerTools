# What is Sigma
Sigma is a leading solution for estimating construction/building cost. Used for house extensions, office buildings, hospitals, and integrates with 2D and 3D take-off systems. It features an open API which allows for new features and integrations for webservices (REST) and other desktop software (COM).
